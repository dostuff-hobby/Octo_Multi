# Octo_Multi
Custom script to setup mulitple Octoprint instances on a single Pi

This script was written in my spare time and presently has only been tested on Ubuntu 20.04 and Rasbian 10 and thus is only presently supporting a Debian-based or apt based package manager workflow.

This script is intended to be run only one time and for a fresh configuration, the error checking isn't phenominal so multiple executions are likely to present errors.

The script contains a block of common plugins that I use personally that you may disable or modify to suit your needs.
